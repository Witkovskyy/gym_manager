# gym_manager
This idea came to my mind basically because I'm employed as a gym receptionist currently.
I want to expand my portfolio and maybe implement this at my workplace to make my job easier;)

This project uses:

- Sqlite - For db storage

- SqlAlchemy v. 20.0.38 - To operate on db with python

- PyQt6 v. 6.8.1 - For UI purposes

I'm using Python 3.12.2.



Entries in example db's are randomly generated for debugging purposes.
