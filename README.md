## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gym_manager.git
cd gym_manager
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Initialize the database (if not already created)**

Make sure the database schema is set up. You can use Alembic, or ensure `db_setup.py` is run to create tables via SQLAlchemy.
